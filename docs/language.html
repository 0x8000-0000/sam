<h1 class="title">Semantic Authoring Markdown (SAM)</h1>

<div class="introduction">
<div class="note">
<p class="p">This document is a formal description of the SAM language. It describes the formalisms behind the syntax and it may make SAM sound a lot more complex to work with than it really is. If you just want to learn how to write in SAM, see the <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="document">SAM Quick Start</span></span>.</p>
</div>
<p class="p">Semantic Authoring Markdown (SAM) is a simplified markup for semantic authoring. Semantic authoring means writing texts that identify some part of their semantics thought embedded markup. Semantic authoring also places constraints on the author, making sure they create the content that is required. Semantic authoring allows for sophisticated validation and manipulation of content, supporting increased quality and improving the efficiency of the publishing process.</p>
<p class="p">SAM is a tale that grew in the telling. It was designed from the bottom up, not the top down, and so formalizing the language description comes after the fact. This document is a step along the way to a fully formal definition. There is not yet a full formal grammar for SAM. It is possible that the development of such a grammar could reveal ambiguities in the language definition that might require design changes in the future.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Why SAM?</h2>

<p class="p">Why is SAM needed? What are the limits of current semantic authoring solutions? The core of a semantic authoring solution is a markup language. There are, broadly, two kinds of markup languages: general and lightweight. Lightweight markup languages are easier to use, but less capable. <span class="phrase"><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML class="link">XML</a></span> is the only general languages in common use today (thought SGML is also still in use). There are many lightweight markup languages. The best known is Markdown.</p>
<p class="p">The key issue for real semantic authoring is extensibility: the ability to specify your own semantics. (To create new tag that are specific to what you are writing about.)</p>
<p class="p">Current lightweight markup languages have fixed semantics with little or no extensibility. Where extensibility exists, it generally requires coding extensions to the parser.</p>
<p class="p">XML supports extensibility through schemas. But the price it pays for this is an abstract data model and a verbose syntax. Writing and editing in XML is cumbersome, even with a dedicated XML editor (and dedicated XML editors can be expensive). And while XML is intended for doing structured writing, in practice it tends to hide the structure of the content either behind a WYSIWYG editing interface or verbose markup.</p>
<p class="p">SAM attempts to bridge these two worlds, providing a lightweight syntax that is easy to read, write, and edit, and which makes the structure of the content clear and explicit. SAM is also designed to be extensible and to support the specification of new tags through a schema. (Currently the SAM Parser uses an XML schema language to validate the output XML, but a true SAM schema language is planned.)</p>
<p class="p">Most lightweight markup languages provide a fixed set of document structures with little or no extensibility. XML provides no document structures by default and makes you specify everything in a schema. SAM defines a limited set of core text structures such as paragraph and lists and then leaves it to you to specify the semantic structures that contain the text.</p>
<p class="p">It is important to note that SAM is not designed as a language for text representation. That is, it is not a language designed for taking an existing text, and, without violence to that text, adding metadata to explicate its meaning or structure. For that you need a form of markup with the ability to clearly delineate in-band and out-of-band data. XML provides this by consigning in-band data (the text of the document) to the textual content of elements, and out-of-band (metadata describing the document) to attributes. SAM defines a few preset management attributes but provided no facility for creating new ones. Any additional metadata you want to add to a block, for instance, has to take the form or fields. This muddies the distinction between in-band and out-of-band information. For content creation, this is entirely appropriate, and the whole element/attribute distinction is tedious and confusing. If you are looking for a markup language that is designed so that you can simply remove the markup and be left with the original document, SAM is not the right choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Processing model</h2>

<p class="p">SAM is a cross between an abstract or meta language like XML and a concrete language like MarkDown. XML does not describe the semantics of any of the tagging languages you base on it. The XML parser does not implement any markup semantics. Implementing semantics is left to the application layer -- another program or set of program that process the output of the parser. In many XML-based tool chains, the application layer is written in XSLT. Markdown describes the entire semantics of the language. The Markdown processor executes the entire semantics of the language, producing HTML output directly from Markdown. It does not require a separate application layer.</p>
<p class="p">SAM follows the XML model. The SAM parser simply reads the SAM markup and extracts its structures. It does not interpret the semantics of the document, but leaves that to the application layer.</p>
<p class="p">A SAM parser may make the structure of a SAM document available to the applications layer in different ways. It can expose the structure via an API and/or it may output an XML representation of the structure of the SAM document.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Semantics</h2>

<p class="p">While the SAM parser does not act on the semantics of the document, deferring that to the application layer, it contains concrete markup which the writer is entitled to expect will be processed in a particular way. These are the intended semantics of SAM structures. The application layer is expected to honor and implement the semantics of SAM markup.</p>
<p class="p">A lot of SAM's concrete markup is simply shortcuts for common writing structures like lists. The exact same structures could be created using blocks, fields, and paragraphs, and you can create variant structures (other types of lists, for example) using these standard components. However, some of SAM's concrete markup expresses a particular view about markup language design. For example, it use of annotations and citations expresses a particular view about how text inside paragraphs should be marked up. Since SAM does not provide other facilities to create markup in paragraphs, it may not be suitable for expressing all types of markup language design. SAM is not, and is not intended to be, a full replacement for XML.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">SAM Structure</h2>

<p class="p">Like all other markup languages, a SAM document is essentially a set a set of nested blocks of various types. In concrete markup languages like markdown there are a fixed set of block types, each with a specific meaning, and each with a corresponding piece of syntax that allows the parser to identify them. In an abstract markup language like XML, there are a few abstract block types that have no inherent meaning, but can be named so that a processing application can attach meaning to the name in specific markup languages. Thus a paragraph is represented with a <code class="code">&lt;p&gt;</code> element in HTML but by a <code class="code">&lt;para&gt;</code> element in DocBook.</p>
<p class="p">As a hybrid language, SAM has a set of concrete block types, each with its own semantics and syntax, and a set of abstract nameable block types that can be used to define additional semantics for specific SAM-based markup languages. Thus in SAM a <span class="phrase">paragraph</span> is always created as a block of text, but you can create named blocks to capture things like <code class="code">author-name:</code>.</p>
<p class="p">Blocks may contain flows. A flow is a data value, the contents of a block, but a flow can also contain other structures. This is also a common feature of document markup languages. In HTML, for instance, you can have an <code class="code">&lt;a&gt;</code> element in the middle of a paragraph to create a link. XML-based languages, including HTML, use elements for structures within a flow (creating something called mixed content). In SAM, structures within a flow are distinct from blocks and have a different syntax.</p>
<p class="p">Four kinds of structures can exist in a flow, a <span class="phrase">phrase</span>, an <span class="phrase">insert</span>, and a <span class="phrase">citation</span>. However, a <span class="phrase">phrase</span> can be annotated to indicate its semantics, which makes <span class="phrase">phrase</span>s an extensible feature of SAM.</p>
<p class="p">The following example shows a <span class="phrase">paragraph</span> with two annotated <span class="phrase">phrase</span>s.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">In {Rio Bravo}(movie), {the Duke}(actor "John Wayne" (SAG)) plays a union colonel.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">SAM Syntax</h2>

<p class="p">Syntactically, SAM takes its cues from YAML and Python (for displaying overall structure), from Markdown (for displaying text structures) and from common English usage (for displaying annotations.) In contrast to some of the richer lightweight markup languages, it tries to minimize the use of exotic forms of punctuation to delineate structures.</p>
<p class="p">The intention is that an author writing in SAM should feel no need to use a visual editor, but should work directly in raw SAM (albeit with editor-supplied syntax coloring if desired). A SAM document should be a very natural read.</p>
<p class="p">SAM is not designed to be a full replacement for XML. It is far less general, because of its use of predefined syntax for common text structures such as lists and paragraphs, and it has very limited support for attributes. Basically, each structure has a fixed set of attributes available. There is no extensibility for attributes. This is essential to maintain the readability of SAM sources, but it limits certain styles of markup design.</p>
<p class="p">In particular, SAM is designed to support a declarative approach to semantic authoring meaning that it is designed to express declarations about the structure of the document and the meaning of the text, rather than to embed management and processing information into the source, a practice common in many structured authoring languages.</p>
<p class="p">Document-oriented markup languages such as reStructuredText and Markdown tend to be very flat in structure. One things follows another. There is rarely a case where one thing is inside another. For example, these languages use heading levels, but don't delineate sections of the document. More semantically rich languages tend to be more hierarchical, with one structure inside another. For example, a document might be divided into sections with title and paragraph elements inside a section. This means that you need to show which structures are inside others and where the containing structure ends.</p>
<p class="p">XML does this by having an explicit end tag for every element. A large part of the verbosity of XML comes from its requirement to close every element tag. Many programming languages, which similarly have to express nested structures, use some form of brackets to delineate each structure. Python is an exception to this. It uses indentation to express the relationship between structures. This is a far more natural way for writers to express the subordination of elements -- one that is sometimes also used in published works. SAM uses this approach and avoids the use of end tags entirely.</p>
<p class="p">SAM syntax defines the following structures:</p>
<dl class="ll">
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">named block</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">Named blocks are structures that contain other structures. For instance, a section is a block. Blocks must have names. Named blocks (and named fields) are how you introduce new structures into a SAM document. Named blocks may be referred to a "blocks" in this document, but all of SAMs concrete block types are also blocks.</p>

<div class="ll.li">

</div>
<div class="section" id="nametoken">
<h2 class="title">Name tokens</h2>

<p class="p">Several things in SAM have names. These names must be valid name tokens. A name token in a SAM document must be a valid XML local name. This is to allow ease of integration with XML tools and languages and for a straightforwards serialization of SAM documents to XML.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" data-name="name-like-string">
<h2 class="title">Name-like string</h2>

<p class="p">A name like string is a string that looks like a name. Name-like strings are used in parsing SAM files to detect the intention of the author to create a name. Not all name-like-strings are valid names. If the parser sees a name-like-string that is not a valid name, it reports an error.</p>
<p class="p">The reason for recognizing name-like-strings rather than only recognizing valid names is that it enables the parser to catch cases where the writer probably intended to create a name but failed to create a valid name.</p>
<p class="p">By recognizing name-like-strings the parser is able to report an errors on these dubious cases, which reduce the likelihood or misinterpreting the author's intent. In the case where the name-like-string is indeed intended to be interpreted as plain text, the writer can ensure it is interpreted as such by escaping the concluding colon with a backslash.</p>
<p class="p">However, the definition of a name-like-string can't interfere with the recognition of other SAM structures. Therefore name-like-strings don't include characters that might be mistaken for SAM markup.</p>
<p class="p">The current definition of a name-like-string is as follows, but this is subject to change:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="re"><code class="codeblock">(?P&lt;name&gt;\w[^\s`]*?) 
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section" data-name="syntax">
<h2 class="title">Syntax</h2>

<p class="p">A <span class="phrase">block</span> in SAM is formed by starting a line with a name followed by a colon:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">description:
    This is the content of a block named "description".
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Structures in SAM can contain other structures. The hierarchy of structures in SAM is defined by indentation. In the example above, the paragraph structure is inside the block named description because it is indented under it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" data-name="SOM">
<h2 class="title">SAM Object Model</h2>

<p class="p">The SAM Object Model is a way of representing the structure of a SAM document as a data structure to a computer program. The SAM object model is a way for program to access a SAM document in a standard way. Unless you are concerned with writing programs to access the SAM Object Model you can ignore all references to it in this document. The SAM Object model is the model implemented by the current SAM parser, which is written in Python. However, SAM parsers are not required to implement the SAM Object Model.</p>
<p class="p">The other way for applications to access the structure of is by serializing it to XML. This is the only require access method for parsers to implement.</p>
<p class="p">Like the language itself, the SOM is a tale that grew in the telling. In the absence of a full formal grammar for SAM, the object model must be considered provisional. It should be considered a less stable interface to a SAM document than the canonical XML serialization.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" data-name="parser">
<h2 class="title">Parsing</h2>

<p class="p">A SAM document may be interpreted by a SAM parser to form an object tree in memory, which can include the <span class="phrase">SAM object model</span> or any standardized XML representation such as SAX or DOM. In these cases, the DOM or SAX interface should represent the standard XML serialization, or an optional variant of that serialization, not the SOM. A SAM parser must offer the option of serializing the document as XML. A SAM parser may offer various methods of serializing XML, but it must default to the serialization described in this document.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="structures">
<p class="p">The following is a list of the structures of a SAM document.</p>
<div class="structure" data-name="root">
<h2 class="title">Root</h2>

<p class="p">Every SAM document has a root which contains the entire content of the document. The root can contain a single block which is the parent of all other blocks in the document. This block is called the <span class="phrase">document block</span>.</p>
<div class="syntax">

<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">None. The root is just a container.</p>

<p class="p">One or more <span class="phrase">declaratiom</span>s.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p">One of more <span class="phrase">comment</span>s, <span class="phrase">remark</span>s, or <span class="phrase">string definition</span>s.</p>

<div class="SOM">
<p class="p">The <span class="phrase">root</span> is represented by a <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="SOM_object">Root</span></span> object that is created automatically by the parser when parsing starts.</p>
<p class="p">All <span class="phrase">declarations</span>, <span class="phrase">comments</span>, <span class="phrase">remarks</span>, and <span class="phrase">string definitions</span> prior to the document block, and the document block itself, are children of the <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="SOM_object">Root</span></span> object.</p>
<p class="p">Note that the SOM <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="SOM_object">Root</span></span> object is not the same thing as the <span class="phrase">document block</span>. The <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="SOM_object">Root</span></span> object is a container for all the structures declared at column zero in the SAM document. The <span class="phrase">document block</span> is the only <span class="phrase">block structure</span> permitted as a direct child of the <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="SOM_object">Root</span></span> object.</p>

It is the container for all other blocks in the document.</p>
<p class="p">Any type of <span class="phrase">block</span> can be the <span class="phrase">document block</span>. However, choosing a structure other than a <span class="phrase">named block</span> as the document block will be extremely limiting, as most <span class="phrase">concrete block</span> types allow for little or no nesting of other blocks. For instance, nothing can be nested under a <span class="phrase">paragraph</span> so while a paragraph can be the document block of a SAM document, it would also be the only structure in the document.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p class="p">The <span class="phrase">document block</span> is not indented. All other structures in the document (excluding <span class="phrase">comments</span>, <span class="phrase">declarations</span>, and <span class="phrase">string definitions</span>) must be children of the <span class="phrase">document block</span>, and therefore must be indented under it. In all other respects, the syntax of the document block is the syntax of it type.</p>

<div class="semantics">

<h2 class="title">Named Block</h2>

<p class="p">A <span class="phrase">named block</span> is an abstract structure which allows you to extend SAM to express many different document structures. The name of a <span class="phrase">named block</span> must be a valid <span class="phrase">SAM name</span>.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p class="p">A named block is indicated by the appropriate indent followed by a <span class="phrase">name-like string</span>, followed by a colon:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">movie-review:
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To be considered a block, rather than a <span class="phrase">field</span>, a <span class="phrase">block</span> must have children. Children can be any other block types:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">movie-review:
    movie: Rio Bravo
    stars:
        star: John Wayne
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The example above contains two blocks (<code class="code">movie-review</code> and <code class="code">stars</code>) and two <span class="phrase">fields</span> (<code class="code">movie</code>) and (<code class="code">star</code>).</p>
<p class="p">A named block can have a value:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">movie-review: Rio Bravo is Classic Western
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Here the string "Rio Bravo" is the value of the block. The value of a block is regarded as the title of document section formed by a block, and is serialized as such.</p>
<p class="p">A named block can have <span class="phrase">attributes</span>.</p>
<p class="p">A block can also have a title:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">section:(?ultra)(#ultra) The ultra feature is really cool!
</code></pre>
<p class="p">If there is any value after the colon and the attributes, it is considered a title for the <span class="phrase">block</span> and generates a title structure. There must be a space between the colon or the closing parenthesis and the value.</p>
<p class="p">Blocks have children. To be considered a <span class="phrase">block</span>, a structure must have children. That is, it must have other structures indented underneath it. If it has no children, it is interpreted as a <span class="phrase">field</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">The title of a a <span class="phrase">block</span> is treated as the title of a the entire content of a <span class="phrase">block</span>, and will be serialized as such.</p>
<p class="p">Structurally, the title of a <span class="phrase">block</span> is its value, in just the same way that the content of a field is its value.</p>
</div>
<div class="serialization">
<p class="p">Thus the SAM markup above would create the following XML output:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="xml"><code class="codeblock">&lt;section conditions="ultra"&gt;

    ...

</div>
<div class="SOM">
<p class="p">The representation of a block in the <span class="phrase">SOM</span> is identical to the representation of a field. A block is distinguished from a field in the SOM by whether or not it has children.</p>

<div class="structure" data-name="attribute">
<h2 class="title">Attributes</h2>

<p class="p">Attributes are metadata on a block or <span class="phrase">phrase</span>.</p>
<div class="syntax">

<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">name:(?BC) Fred Flintstone

<p class="p">A block can have multiple attributes, one after another, with no spaces between:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">name:(?BC)(#fred) Fred Flintstone 
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Attributes on <span class="phrase">phrases</span> are contained in parentheses that follow the closing curly brace of the phrase or the closing parenthesis or bracket of another <span class="phrase">annotation</span>, <span class="phrase">attribute</span>, or <span class="phrase">citation</span>.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock"></code></pre>
<p class="p">An attribute annotation looks like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">In Quebec, a stop sign says {arrêt}(!fr).

<p class="p">A <span class="phrase">phrase</span> can have an unlimited mix of attributes, <span class="phrase">annotations</span>, and <span class="phrase">citations</span> attached to it.</p>
<p class="p">There are four general attributes. The type of an attribute it determined by the flag character that precedes it. The four general types are:</p>

<p class="p">Languages should be <span class="phrase"><a href=https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/ class="link">BCP 47</a></span> language codes, but the parser is not required to enforce this.</p>
<p class="p">Certain block types take additional attributes with meanings specific to those block types.</p>
</div>
<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">Attributes provide support for basic <span class="phrase">management domain</span> metadata in a SAM file.</p>
<p class="p">Unlike XML, SAM does not support arbitrarily named attributes. Only a fixed set of management attributes are supported. The semantics of each attribute type is as follows:</p>
<dl class="ll">
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">Condition</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">A <span class="phrase">condition</span> attribute is used to determine if a block should appear in a particular output or not. If the condition expression evaluates to true, then the block is included. If it evaluates to false, it is not included.</p>
<p class="p">Conditions are evaluated from the outside in, so if a block is conditional excluded, all its contents are excluded, regardless of any conditional expressions that may occur on any of its children.</p>
<p class="p">The syntax, interpretation, and truth values of condition expressions are left entirely to the application layer. Similarly, including or excluding blocks is left entirely to the application layer.</p>
<p class="p">Multiple conditions may be applied to the same block.</p>
</dd>
</div>
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">ID</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">An <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="feature">id</span></span> attribute assigns an ID to a block. That id can be referenced by an <span class="phrase">idref</span>. IDs must be unique in a file. IDRefs must refer to an ID in the current file. The action to be taken by the application layer on encountering an IDref is up to the tagging language designer.</p>
<p class="p">Multiple ids are not permitted on the same block.</p>
</dd>
</div>
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">Name</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">A <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="feature">name</span></span> attribute assigns a name to a block. A name performs the same function as an ID, allowing the block to be references from elsewhere. However, there are no limits on the scope of names. Uniqueness of names is not enforced. Name references are not required to match a name in the current file. This allows you to use names to reference blocks in other files. (Note the namerefs so not support naming the file in which a name is located. Rather it is left to the application layer to locate names by whatever mechanism seems appropriate.)</p>

<dt class="ll.li.label">Language</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">A <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="feature">language</span></span> attribute specified the language in which the content of a block is written.

Any metadata that can be expressed by an attribute on a block can also be expressed by a field that is a child of that block.

The specifically attribute is a string in double or single straight quotes. In the sample above, "the Duke" means, specifically, "John Wayne". The specifically attribute is optional.</p>
</dd>
</div>
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">namespace</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">In some cases, it is necessary to specify the namespace to which the annotated term belongs. The namespace attribute follows the specifically attribute (if specified) and is contained in parentheses. In the sample above, the name of the actor "John Wayne" is part of a set of names managed by the Screen Actors Guild which makes sure two actors don't use the same stage name. (In most cases, the namespace is implied by the type, so you will not usually need to specify it.) The namespace attribute is optional.</p>

</div>
<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">The specific semantics of individual annotation depend on the language designer, however, in order to maintain consistency across languages, it is important to use the specifically and namespace attributes for their intended purposes and not to hijack them to express some other semantics.</p>
<p class="p">Annotations may be from any of the <span class="phrase">structured writing domains</span> (media, document, subject, management). The relationship between the annotation type and the meaning of the specifically attribute changes in each domain.</p>
<p class="p">In the media domain, the annotation type refers to some media property to be applied to the text, and the specifically attribute supplies more specific information. For example it could be <code class="code">{the Duke}(highlight "yellow")</code> or <code class="code">{the Duke}(link "http://JohnWayne.com")</code>.</p>
<p class="p">In the document domain, the annotation type refer to some document property, and the specifically attribute supplies more specific information. For example, it could be <code class="code">{the Duke}(index "Wayne, John")</code>.</p>
<p class="p">In the subject domain, the annotation type refers to the type of the subject being referred to and the specifically attribute clarifies the intended subject if required. For example `<span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="actor" data-specifically="John Wayne">the Duke</span></span>.</p>
<p class="p">The key to using the annotation attributes correctly is simply to make sure that the attribute names apply in a reasonable fashion to the values they contain. If they don't, a different markup strategy should be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="serialization">
<p class="p">An annotation is serialized as an <code class="code">&lt;annotation&gt;</code> element. The type, specifically, and namespace attributes become attributes with those names in XML.</p>
<p class="p">The <code class="code">&lt;annotation&gt;</code> element is wrapped inside the <code class="code">&lt;phrase&gt;</code> element that it annotation, with the content of the phrase on the inside.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="xml"><code class="codeblock">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;phrase&gt;&lt;annotation type="movie"&gt;Rio Bravo&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/phrase&gt;, &lt;phrase&gt;&lt;annotation type="actor" specifically="John Wayne" namespace="SAG&gt;the Duke&lt;/annotation&gt;&lt;/phrase&gt; plays a union colonel.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">When a phrase has one or more annotations, those annotations are wrapped inside the <code class="code">&lt;phrase&gt;</code> element in the order in which they occur in the source document. Thus the following:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">The film starred {John Wayne}(actor)(director), who also directed.

<p class="p">would be serialized as:</p>

<p class="p">A citation is created using square brackets:</p>

<p class="p">SAM has no opinion about the format of a citation text. That is entirely up to the application layer to decipher.</p>
<p class="p">You can also use citations to reference other parts of the current document or other documents. To cite a resource that has an id within the current SAM document, reference the id like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">Moby Dick is about a big fish[*moby]. See [*whale].

<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">The function of a citation is to generate a piece of content in the output that is a reference to the specified resource. Some text should always be generated in the place where the citation is specified. What type of reference that is depends of the type of object that is being referenced. Generating such references is the job of the <span class="phrase">application layer</span>.</p>
<p class="p">The purpose of a citation is not to create a link. Links should be created using <span class="phrase">annotation</span>s. However, the reference generated by a citation may include a link to the resource in question if appropriate.</p>
<p class="p">The semantics of a reference by <span class="phrase">idref</span>, <span class="phrase">nameref</span>, or <span class="phrase">keyref</span>, depend on the type of the structure referred to. Thus if the type of a object referred to by an <span class="phrase">idref</span>. This will usually be a reference to a type that is created in the specific tagging language being used, rather than to a SAM concrete block, so the semantics are up to the language designer. For example, if your tagging language includes footnotes, as in the last example above then the presumptive semantics of a <span class="phrase">citation</span> of the footnote ID would be to product a footnote marker in the output.</p>
<p class="p">The semantics of a citation of an external work is that it will generate a reference to that work in whatever citation format is appropriate for publication. This means that a citation that is inline in the SAM document necessarily implies that an inline citation format will be used on output. The SAM citation is just capturing the citation information. It is up to the application layer to decide how to present it, including removing the citation to a footnote or endnote if appropriate. The language designer is entitled to specify any citation format they like, and to interpret it in any way they like.</p>

<p class="p">Inserts may be created at the <span class="phrase">block</span> level or inside a <span class="phrase">flow</span>.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p class="p">At the block level, an insert is placed on a line by itself and is indicated by three greater-than signs:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">&gt;&gt;&gt;(image foo.png)

<p class="p">Inside a <span class="phrase">flow</span>, an insert is indicated by a single greater-than followed the the identification of the resource in parentheses:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">My favorite flavor of ice cream is &gt;[$favorite-flavor].

<p class="p">The resource to be inserted may be identified either by type and URL as in the block example above or by reference to an <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="feature">id</span></span>, <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="feature">name</span></span>, <span class="phrase">fragment</span>, <span class="phrase">string</span>, or <span class="phrase">key</span> as in the flow example.</p>
<p class="p">You can also assign <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="feature">name</span></span>s, <span class="phrase">condition</span>s, or <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="feature">id</span></span>s to an insert. For example, to insert a fragment containing the introduction to the deluxe version of a product, you could do this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">&gt;&gt;&gt;[~deluxe-intro](?model=deluxe)
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Remember that it is up to the application layer to implement such inserts.</p>
<p class="p">You can use any name you like for the insert type, however the following types are reserved so that editors can act on them to provide enhanced views of the document while editing:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">
<p class="p">image</p>

</ul>
<p class="p">They should be used only with their natural semantics. Note, however, that the spec does not prescribe a mechanism for identifying the object to insert. The item will, of course, be identified by a URL, but how that URL is to be interpreted is not specified. For instance, it could point to an XML file that contain information used to choose the appropriate object for a particular media. The SAM language spec does not specify the format or interpretation for such a file. (Perhaps another spec will get written to some point for that mechanism, if it proves useful for multiple projects.)</p>

<h2 class="title">Codeblock</h2>

<p class="p">A codeblock is a block of computer code or data, or any other material with its own syntax that is to be presented as part of the document content. The contents of a codeblock are not interpreted by the SAM parser but are presented as entered in the source.</p>
<div class="syntax">
<p class="p">Codeblocks begin with three back ticks followed by optional <span class="phrase">attribute</span>s.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">```(python)
    print("Hello World.")
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Code must be indented under the codeblock marker. The codeblock ends at the first line that is less indented than the codeblock marker, or at the end of the file.</p>
<p class="p">Codeblocks take the standard <span class="phrase">attribute</span> types.</p>
<p class="p">Because is is delineated by indentation, the contents of a codeblock do not require any character escaping, and no SAM character escapes are recognized in a codeblock. The text is taken literally without modification of any kind.</p>
<p class="p">Thus, for instance, you can show blocks of SAM in a SAM codeblock (as this document does) without any need for escaping any part of the markup.</p>
</div>
<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">The text of the codeblock is not processed as SAM markup. It is recorded as is with no interpretation or escape processing. Line breaks are preserved as in the original.</p>
<p class="p">Because indentation may be significant in a codeblock, and because the code will be indented under the codeblock header in the SAM source, the SAM parser uses the following algorithm to distinguish SAM indenting from indenting in the code itself: The parser looks at all the lines that are indented under the codeblock header, finds the one with the smallest indent, and treats it as occurring at the first column in the code. This allows for cases where the first line of a code sample may not be the least indented line. (That is, the first line of the code sample may be more indented than some of the lines that follow.) It also means that all codeblocks will be formatted with zero initial indent.</p>
<p class="p">The semantics of the language attribute are slightly different for codeblocks, or at least, the implication of the semantics is. For other blocks, the language attribute denotes the human language of the text. For a codeblock, it denotes the computer or data language of the codeblock. In the unlikely event that you need to apply both languages, you should use a wrapper around the codeblock to capture the human language. For example, you might do this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">code-sample:(fr)

Generally, speaking, placing a remark after the paragraph it remarks on should be sufficient, however, if you want to anchor a remark to a specific spot in a paragraph, you can do so by giving the remark an <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="feature">ID</span></span> <span class="phrase">attribute</span> and referring to it using a <span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="object">citation</span></span>:</p>

<p class="p">A decoration is a shortcut for creating an annotated phrase. They are used for common text formatting features  bold, and italic. Decorations are shortcuts, so</p>

<p class="p">is a shortcut for</p>

<div class="syntax">
<p class="p">Decoration are indicated by charters in the text that bracket phrases. The decorations are as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><code class="code">*</code> is a decoration for bold.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p"><code class="code">_</code> is a decoration for italic</p>

<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">This text is _italic_ type.

<p class="p">Decorations cannot be nested, so</p>

</code></pre>
<p class="p">is not a shortcut for</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">This text is {important}(bold)(italic)

<p class="p">but would be interpreted as</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">This text is {_important_}(bold).
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Decorations are not recognized inside of <span class="phrase">phrase</span>s, since decorations are shorcuts for phrases and phrases cannot be nested. Decoration characters inside annotations are read as plain text.</p>
<p class="p"><span class="phrase"><span class="annotation" data-annotation-type="structure" data-specifically="annotation">Annotation</span></span> chaining is supported for decorations. Therefore if you want to make text both both and italic, you could use:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">This text is *important*(italic)

<p class="p">Although it may be clearer to do this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">This text is {important}(bold)(italic)

<div class="semantics">
<p class="p">In SAM, the bold and italic decorations are media domain structures calling for the use of bold and italic typefaces respectively. This is in contrast to most lightweight markup languages which use them (or similar markup) to mean an abstraction like "emphasis" or "strong". The problem with these abstractions is that their meaning in not clear. Bold and italic type are conventionally used for specific purposes and should not be abstracted out without some definite indication of the purpose. Thus in SAM, you would normally expect a tagging language that expected the titles of books to occur regularly in content would provide a suitable <code class="code">title</code> annotation to mark them up.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">{Moby Dick}(book) is about a whale.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">But if there the tagging language provides no such support, because books are not a significant subject for that language, then the writer who needs to mention a book should not be forced to use a vague and unreliable abstraction like <code class="code">emphasis</code> in order to ensure proper formatting of the title. They should be able to specify the correct media domain formatting choice:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">_Moby Dick_ is about a whale.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Which is equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">{Moby Dick}(italic) is about a whale.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">And we should note in this case that the abstract <code class="code">emphasis</code> is not only vague, it is actually incorrect. This is not a case of emphasizing a word, but of formatting a book title according to the commonly accepted convention. If you actually want an emphasis annotation in your tagging language, you should do it like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock">{Moby Dick}(italic) is a {very}(emphasis) good book.
