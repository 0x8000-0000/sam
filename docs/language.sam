	section: Images
	
		Images inside a paragraph are indicated with an image name in brackets followed by the type annotation (image):
		
		```sam
		This is a picture of a kitten. [kitten](image) It is funny.
		```
		Resolution of the image name to an actual image is delegated to downstream processing. However, you can also specify a URL:
		
		```sam
		This is a picture of a kitten. [kitten](image "kitten.jpg") It is funny.
		```
		
		It is up to the downstream processing whether to use the image name or the URL to locate the image to display.
		
		You can also skip the image name and just specify the URL, but you must keep the square brackets:
		
		```sam
		This is a picture of a kitten. [](image "kitten.jpg") It is funny.
		```
		
		Images at the paragraph level are indicated as a paragraph containing only an image:
		
		```sam
		[kitten](image)
		```
		
		You can also specify a variable for an image:
		
		```sam
		$kitten = '[kitten](image "kitten.jpg")'
		
		This is a picture of a kitten. $kitten It is funny.
		```
