<p class="p">SAM is a markup language for semantic authoring. It is not a fixed language like Markdown. It is a meta-language like XML. Markdown has a fixed set of document structures that you can use. SAM, like XML, lets you define and create your own structures to suit your own needs. Unlike XML, however, and like Markdown, SAM is designed to be easy to write in a plain text editor. SAM also provides a set of basic default structures that are shared by all SAM document types. This base set is deliberately basic. It is designed to make certain common structures easy to create. There are other document structures you will probably need that you will have to design for your self using SAM's blocks and annotations. See the <span class="phrase">SAM Recipes</span> document for some suggestions on how to create some commonly used document structures.</p>
<p class="p">SAM is designed for structured writing. That is, writing that obeys a specific defined structure that tells you what goes into a document and how it is expressed. A structured document is also one that you can process with algorithms in order to validate the content, create new forms of content, or publish the content to different media and for different purposes. The key to successful structured writing is that the writer must be able to clearly see the structure as they are writing. That is not the case with XML, whether you write it in a plain text editor or in a sophisticated XML editor that make it look like a Word document. Verbose XML tags obscure structure and Word-like interfaces hide structure behind an approximation of final formatting.</p>
<p class="p">Structured writing essentially divides content into a set of nested names blocks. SAM introduces blocks with a one word label followed by a colon. It shows the nesting of one block inside another by indenting the nested block under its parent. Here is an example of a structured document, a recipe, written in SAM:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">recipe: Hard Boiled Egg
    introduction:
        A hard boiled egg is simple and nutritious. It makes
        a quick and delicious addition to any breakfast.

        Hard boiled eggs can also be an ingredients in
        other dishes, such as a {Cobb Salad}(recipe).

    ingredients:: ingredient, quantity
        eggs, 12
        water, 2qt
    preparation:
        1. Place eggs in pan and cover with water.
        2. Bring water to a boil.
        3. Remove from heat and cover for 12 minutes.
        4. Place eggs in cold water to stop cooking.
        5. Peel and serve.
    prep-time: 15 minutes
    serves: 6
    wine-match: champagne and orange juice
    beverage-match: orange juice
    nutrition:
        serving: 1 large (50 g)
        calories: 78
        total-fat: 5 g
        saturated-fat: 0.7 g
        polyunsaturated-fat: 0.7 g
        monounsaturated-fat: 2 g
        cholesterol: 186.5 mg
        sodium: 62 mg
        potassium: 63 mg
        total-carbohydrate: 0.6 g
        dietary-fiber: 0 g
        sugar: 0.6 g
        protein: 6 g
</code></pre>
<p class="p">All SAM documents consist of a single root block, in this case the block labeled "recipe". That block contains a number of other blocks with labels like "ingredients" and "nutrition". Some of these block also contain other blocks.  Thus the individual fields that make up the nutrition information are indented under the <code class="code">nutrition:</code> label. (Blocks that contain just a single value are called "fields".</p>
<p class="p">This is a semantic version of a recipe. It does not tell you how the recipe should be formatted. It does not even contain the section headings that will probably be used when the recipe is printed on paper or screen. To actually make a printed recipe, the semantic version needs to be processed by an algorithm that decides which pieces of information to publish, what order to publish them in, what titles to use for the sections, how to format the text, and which media to publish to. However, the semantic version lets you do cool stuff like make a collection of recipes with less than 80 calories per serving that can be prepared in less than 20 minutes, because it makes those pieces of information clearly available to algorithms for querying and processing. It also helps to make sure the people writing recipes provide all the information we need in the order and form we want it in.</p>
<p class="p">The main parts of a SAM document as as follows.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Blocks</h2>

<p class="p">A block is a container for other structures. It has a label. It may also have a title. In the example above, <code class="code">recipe:</code> starts a block that contains the entire recipe document. <code class="code">nutrition:</code> starts a block that contains the nutrition information. Blocks are delimited by indentation. Everything indented under the block tag is part of the block. Every SAM document must have a single root block that contains all the content of the document.</p>
<p class="p">The recipe block has a title, "Hard Boiled Egg", which is the text after the colon in <code class="code">recipe:</code>.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">recipe: Hard Boiled Egg
</code></pre>
<p class="p">This is a shortcut and is exactly equivalent to this (provided there is nothing indented under the <code class="code">title</code> tag):</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">recipe:
    title: Hard Boiled Egg
    introduction:
        A hard boiled egg is simple and nutritious. It makes
        a quick and delicious addition to any breakfast.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Fields</h2>

<p class="p">A field is a container for a single value. Each of the lines in the nutrition block is a field. For example, <code class="code">sugar: 0.6 g</code> is a field with the label <code class="code">sugar</code> and the value <code class="code">0.6 g</code>. A field has the same format as a block except that there is nothing indented under it. If you indent something under a field it will become a block and its value will become the title of the block.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Paragraphs</h2>

<p class="p">A paragraph is a string of text. Paragraphs may run over several lines. A paragraph ends with a blank line or when the block it belongs to ends (which means when next line is less indented). A paragraph is a kind of block but it does not require a label. Its block name is <code class="code">p</code> but this is completely implicit. Paragraphs may not have children. That is, you can't indent anything under a paragraph.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Lists</h2>

<p class="p">You can create ordered lists by using numbers followed by a period to start each line of the list.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">1. Place eggs in pan and cover with water.
2. Bring water to a boil.
3. Remove from heat and cover for 12 minutes.
4. Place eggs in cold water to stop cooking.
5. Peel and serve.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Unordered lists can be created the same way using asterisks.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">* Dog
* Cat
* Monkey
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Lists are blocks, as are each item in the list. The content of a list item is a paragraph. Therefore the equivalent XML structure to the SAM structure above is:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="xml"><code class="codeblock" data-language="xml">&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dog&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cat&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Monkey&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Phrases:</h2>

<p class="p">A phrase is a piece of text within a paragraph that you want to apply metadata to. A phrase is marked up with curly braces. In the recipe example, the words "Cobb Salad" are marked up as a phrase: <code class="code">{Cobb Salad}</code>. We mark up phrases so that we can add semantic information to them with <span class="phrase">annotations</span> and <span class="phrase">citations</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Annotations</h2>

<p class="p">An annotation is a way of adding descriptive labels or metadata to individual phrases within a text. Annotations can cover anything from formatting (bold, italic) to linking to semantic annotation. Annotations are applied to phrases. In the example above, the phrase "Cobb Salad" has an annotation "recipe" (<code class="code">{Cobb Salad}(recipe)</code>) which tells us that the phrase is the name of a recipe. There is no fixed set of annotations in SAM. It is up to you to determine what annotations you need for your content.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Annotation chaining</h2>

<p class="p">You cannot markup one phrase inside another phrase, however, you can add more than one annotation to a phrase. To add additional annotations, simply follow one with another without any space between them:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">{Clint Eastwood}(actor)(director) stared in and directed {Gran Torino}(movie).
</code></pre>
<p class="p">You can also chain <span class="phrase">annotations</span> and <span class="phrase">citations</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Annotation lookup</h2>

<p class="p">You do not have to repeat the full annotation of a phrase that occurs multiple times in a document. If you have already annotated a phrase once in a document, you can simply mark it as a phrase (by wrapping it in curly braces) and the parser will look back through the document for the last time that phrase was annotated and copy the most recent annotation to the current phrase. In no annotation of that phrase is found, the parser will raise a warning. This is informational only, it is not an error to have an unannotated phrase.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Citations</h2>

<p class="p">Citations are used in cases where you want to refer to another resource. The expectation is that on output the citation markup will be replaced by text that creates a reference to that resource. (Note that this is different from an annotation which might lead to a link being created on a phrase, but will not change the content of the phrase.</p>
<p class="p">Citations come in two forms. Citations of internal names/ids, and citations of external resources. Citations can be applied to:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">
<p class="p">a point in a flow</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p">a phrase</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p">a blockquote</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">To cite a resource that has an id within the current SAM document, reference the id like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">Moby Dick is about a big fish[*moby]. See [*whale].

fig:(*whale)
    &gt;&gt;(image whale.png)

footnote:(*moby)
    Actually, Moby Dick is a whale, not a fish.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">(Note that <code class="code">fig</code> and <code class="code">footnote</code> are not part of SAM itself. They are block types in a particular language defined using SAM. Whether or not your SAM-based tagging language supports <code class="code">fig</code> or <code class="code">footnote</code>, and what they mean in that language, is entirely up to you. This is just an example of how you might use citations in your tagging language.)</p>
<p class="p">To cite a named resource within your content set, reference the name like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">Moby Dick[#MobyDick] is about a big fish.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Or like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">{Moby Dick}[#MobyDick] is about a big fish.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The advantage of applying the citation to a phrase is that it allows you to turn the citation into a link in online content.</p>
<p class="p">This assumes that there is a bibliographic entry with the named <code class="code">MobyDick</code> somewhere in your content set.</p>
<p class="p">To cite an external work without referring to another resource in your content set, use a standard reference syntax.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">Moby Dick[Melville, 1851] is about a big fish.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">SAM does not attempt to decode the format of this style of citation. It just delivers it as a string to the application layer.</p>
<p class="p">The application layer is responsible for all processing of references. Since the syntax does not make any distinction between the types of references being made (<code class="code">*foo</code> could be the name of any block, such as a graphic, a footnote, or a bibliographic entry) the presumed semantics of a tagging language that uses citations is that the treatment of the citation is based on the type of object that the citation references, not the type of the citation. Thus in the example above, <code class="code">[*whale]</code> is a figure reference because the block with the ID <code class="code">*whale</code> is a figure and <code class="code">[*moby]</code> is a footnote reference because the block with the ID <code class="code">*moby</code> is a footnote.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Links</h2>

<p class="p">Links are a form of annotation. As a meta-language, SAM does not support links itself. It is up to you to decide if your markup language includes support for links or not. However, SAM does reserve the annotation type <code class="code">link</code> for creating links if you want them, and has a shortcut for creating links, which looks like this: <code class="code">{Cobb Salad}(http://allrecipes.com/recipe/14415/cobb-salad/)</code>. That is, if the first thing in the annotation is recognized as a URL, it is assumed to be a link annotation pointing to that URL.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Record sets</h2>

<p class="p">A record set is a kind of table. But because SAM is designed for semantic authoring, record sets are designed more like a database table than a formatted table. The content in a record set could be presented in a table, but it could also be presented in other ways or queried like a database table.</p>
<p class="p">A record set consists of a block containing records. A record is a set of fields. Each record in a record set has the same set of fields of the same type, like a record in a database table. In the recipe example, the ingredients are specified using a record set, with each ingredient forming a record.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">ingredients:: ingredient, quantity
    eggs, 12
    water, 2qt
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The record set label is <code class="code">ingredients::</code> and it is marked with two colons instead of one. The field names follow the two colons, separated by commas. Each line that follows contains a record of an ingredient, with the fields separated by commas. If the above were written using regular blocks and fields rather than a record set, it would look like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">ingredients:
    row:
        ingredient: eggs
        quantity: 12
    row:
        ingredient: water
        quantity: 2qt
</code></pre>
<p class="p">You could use record sets to create a simple table layout:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">table:: cell, cell
    eggs, 12
    water, 2qt
</code></pre>
<p class="p">This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">table:
    row:
        cell: eggs
        cell: 12
    row:
        cell: water
        cell: 2qt
</code></pre>
<p class="p">However, here the semantics of the content has been lost.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Grids</h2>

<p class="p">There is another way to do simple table layouts, using grids. A grid looks like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">+++
    eggs  | 12
    water | 2qt
</code></pre>
<p class="p">This is equivalent to a record set in the form:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">grid:: cell, cell
    eggs, 12
    water, 2qt
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Which is equivalent to blocks and fields like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">grid:
    row:
        cell: eggs
        cell: 12
    row:
        cell: water
        cell: 2qt
</code></pre>
<p class="p">However, using grids can make it easier to read small table-like structures in the SAM source.</p>
<p class="p">There are no advanced table features like table heads or row and column spanning in grids. SAM is intended for semantic authoring rather than complex layout effects. For suggestions on how to handle complex tables in SAM, see the <span class="phrase">SAM Recipes</span> document.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Code Blocks</h2>

<p class="p">A code block is a piece of computer code or perhaps the text of a terminal display. Code blocks are usually presented literally as written, often in a fixed space font and with line breaks in the same place as in the source. Most code blocks are in a specific programming or data structure language which the processing routine may need to know to do things like color coding the syntax. In SAM, a codeblock is introduced with three back ticks. (<code class="code">``</code>`).</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">```(python)
    for i in range(1,10):
        print("Hello World " + str(i))
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The code block must be intended under the codeblock header (the three backticks). The indentation of the code in the code block will be calculated based on the least indented line. Thus in the example above, the line <code class="code">for i in range(1,10):</code> will be treated as having and indent of 0, and the line <code class="code">print("Hello World " + str(i))</code> will have an indent of 4.</p>
<p class="p">The language of the codeblock is given in the annotation immediately following the three back ticks of the header.</p>
<p class="p">The content of a code block is not processed as SAM markup. This means that you do not have to escape any of the characters in your code sample. It also means that you can quote SAM markup itself without it being parsed as SAM markup. (Every example in this document uses exactly this technique.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Blockquotes</h2>

<p class="p">A block quote is a quotation from another document that is set apart from the main text. In SAM, a block quote is introduced by three quotation marks in a row. You can use either double or single quotation marks. The body of the block quote is indented under the block quote header:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">As Lewis Carroll observed:

"""[Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland]
    Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six
    impossible things before breakfast.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The content of a block quote is regular SAM markup and is processed just like any other SAM markup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Lines</h2>

<p class="p">A line is a piece of text with a fixed line ending. Poetry, for example, is a set of lines. Normally, SAM runs the lines of a paragraph together and leaves it up to the publishing software to determine line breaks a publishing time. To preserve the line breaks in your text, use lines. In SAM, lines are created by preceding each line with a pipe character followed by a space (the space is important!):</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">Jabberwocky is a nonsense poem by Lewis Carroll.

"""[Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871)]

    | 'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
    | Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
    | All mimsy were the borogoves,
    | And the mome raths outgrabe.
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Characters</h2>

<p class="p">SAM documents are <span class="phrase">Unicode</span> documents encoded in <span class="phrase">UTF-8</span>. You can therefore enter any character you like as literal text. However, there are two circumstances where you may need to enter characters in a different way:</p>
<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">
<p class="p">You want to enter a character, such as an open curly brace, that is a SAM markup character.</p>
</li>
<li class="li">
<p class="p">You want to enter a character that is not on your keyboard or that is hard to type.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p">To enter a character that is a SAM markup character, precede it with a backslash:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">The curly brace \{ is not a commonly used character.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Note that characters such as the curly brace are only recognized as markup in SAM if they form part of a complete SAM markup structure. Because there is no closing curly brace in the above sentence, the curly brace by itself would still be recognized as text. However, using the backslash character escape is probably still a good idea to prevent accidentally creating markup sequences without realizing it.</p>
<p class="p">To enter characters that are not on your keyboard, you can either type unicode character using whatever keyboard sequence your OS provides or you can enter an XML/HTML style character entity. For example, to enter the symbol for a British pound, you can use the <code class="code">&amp;pound</code> character entity.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">The doggy in the window costs &amp;pound;5.00.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">SAM recognizes all of the HTML character entities. (Note, however, that the recognition of HTML character entities could vary based on the SAM parser used. The current SAM Parser uses the Python html library to do character entity decoding. Running the parser with a different version of the html library might result in a different set of named entities being recognized.)</p>
<p class="p">You can also use XML style numeric and hexadecimal character entities:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">The doggy in the window costs &amp;#163;5.00.
</code></pre>
<div class="and"></div>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">The doggy in the window costs &amp;#xA3;5.00.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Note that the use of character entities is an alternative to using backslash character escapes, so you can do:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">The curly brace &amp;lbrace; is not a commonly used character.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">instead of</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">The curly brace \{ is not a commonly used character.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">If you wish.</p>
<p class="p">To enter a literal backslash into your text you can either do:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">\\
</code></pre>
<p class="p">or</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">&amp;bsol;
</code></pre>
<p class="p">or, if the backslash is not preceding any SAM markup character, you can just enter it alone:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">\
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To enter a literal character escape sequence, you can escape the leading <code class="code">&amp;</code> either with a backslash:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">\&amp;pound;
</code></pre>
<p class="p">or with a character escape:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">&amp;amp;pound;
</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Decorations</h2>

<p class="p">A decoration is a shortcut for entering common types of format related annotation in a paragraph. SAM supports three decorations, for bold, italic, and code. Bold text is contained between asterisks:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">This text *is in bold* type.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">This text {is in bold}(bold) type.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Italic text is contained between underscores:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">This text _is in italic_ type.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">This is equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">This text {is in italic}(italic) type.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Code is contained between backticks:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">Python uses the `print()` function to print output.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">This is almost but not quite equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">Python uses the {print()}(code) function to print output.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Note that the code decoration is not a generic monospaced type decoration. It is intended specifically for code. Text in a code decoration is not parsed the way ordinary SAM markup is parsed. Character escapes are not recognized. The text is presented verbatim. The only character escaping that is done is for the back tick symbol. To enter a literal back tick into a code decoration, use two back ticks in a row.</p>
<p class="p">If you want to specify the language of a piece of inline code, use the full annotation format:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">Python uses the {print()}(code (python)) function to print output.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">But note that in this format, the content of the annotated phrase is parsed like normal SAM content and you need to escape any characters that could be interpreted as SAM markup. Thus if you were referring to the code for a character entity in a code decoration, you would do it like this:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">In XML use `&amp;quot;` to enter a &amp; character.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">This will print the character escape literally. But if you were using the full annotation format, you would need to escape the <code class="code">&amp;</code>:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">In XML use {\&amp;quot;}(code (XML)) to enter a &amp; character.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Also note that the <code class="code">&amp;</code> by itself does not need to be escaped in SAM. It only needs to be escaped if it is part of a complete character entity code.</p>

<h2 class="title">Attributes</h2>

<p class="p">SAM does not have a general attribute mechanism like XML. XML attributes are one of the things that make it hard to write in, even in a structured editor. However, SAM does provide some basic attributes that are commonly needed for content management purposes.</p>
<p class="p">You can attach attributes to blocks and block-like things and to phrases. An attribute looks like an annotation, in the sense that it is contained in parentheses, but attributes as distinguished by an initial character the specifies their type. Thus a condition starts with a question mark <code class="code">(?deluxe)</code>.</p>
<p class="p">To attach an attribute to a block, place it directly after the colon of the block header:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">note:(?basic)
    Do not immerse you Basic model Widget in Water. Only higher
    trim levels are waterproof.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The types are:</p>
<dl class="ll">
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">ID</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">An identifier for the block or field. An ID must be unique in the document. An ID is preceded by an asterisk: <code class="code">*my-id</code>.</p>
</dd>
</div>
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">Name</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">A name also identifies a block or field but it has wider scope. Names are used when you want to identify something across a set of documents. SAM does not check that names are unique across a set of documents (it has no way of knowing what that set might be). Resolution of names is up to the processing software. A name is preceded by a <code class="code">#</code> symbol: <code class="code">#my-name</code>.</p>
</dd>
</div>
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">Condition</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">Specifying a condition token is a way of telling the publishing software to include this block only when a certain condition is true. How the publishing software determines if a condition is true is entirely up to the application layer. A condition attribute is preceded by a <code class="code">?</code>.</p>
</dd>
</div>
<div class="ll.li">
<dt class="ll.li.label">Language</dt>
<dd class="ll.li.item"><p class="p">You can specify the language of a block using a language attribute. The language attribute should a <span class="phrase"><a href=https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/ class="link">W3C language tag</a></span>. It is preceded by a <code class="code">!</code>: <code class="code">!en-CA</code>.</p>
</dd>
</div>
</dl>
<p class="p">You can apply multiple attributes to a block:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">note:(*note.waterproof)(?basic)
    Do not immerse you Basic model Widget in Water. Only higher
    trim levels are waterproof.
</code></pre>
<p class="p">You can only apply one each of the <span class="phrase">id</span>, <span class="phrase">name</span>, and <span class="phrase"><a href=language.html class="link">language</a></span> <span class="phrase">attributes</span>, but you can apply as many condition attributes to a <span class="phrase">block</span> as you need.</p>
<p class="p">Note that if you wish to add other forms of management domain metadata to your blocks you can do so using fields within the block. SAM's set of management domain annotations are just a convenience feature. You can add any management domain metadata you like using regular fields. As a semantic format, there is nothing in SAM that says that all of the content of blocks or fields has to appear in print. Blocks and fields can contain any kind of data or metadata you like. It is up to the publishing algorithms to decide which content to publish and which to use for management purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Inserts</h2>

<p class="p">An insert is an instruction to the <span class="phrase">application layer</span> to insert a resource into the document output.</p>
<p class="p">Inserts may be created at the <span class="phrase">block</span> level or inside a paragraph or field value. At the block level, and insert is placed on a line by itself and is indicated by three greater-than signs:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">&gt;&gt;&gt;(image foo.png)
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Inside a flow, an insert is indicated by a single greater-than followed the the identification of the resource in parentheses:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">My favorite flavor of ice cream is &gt;($favorite-flavor).
</code></pre>
<p class="p">The resource to be inserted may be identified either by type and url as in the block example above or by reference to an id, name, fragment, string, or key as in the flow example.</p>
<p class="p">You can also assign names, conditions, or ids to an insert.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">&gt;&gt;&gt;(image fancy.png)(?model=deluxe)
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Remember that it is up to the application layer to implement such inserts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">Includes</h2>

<p class="p">You can include one SAM file in another. The included file must be a complete SAM file, with SAM declaration. Its structured is included in the structure of the included file at the indent level of the include statement.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">&lt;&lt;&lt;(foo.sam)
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Unlike inserts, which are simply parsed by the parser and passed on to the application layer for processing, includes are executed by the parser. The result of the include is presented to the application layer as part of the parsed document.</p>
<p class="p">The ID uniqueness constraint that applies to individual SAM document also applies to included files. The IDs must be unique across the entire document parsed from the source file and any included files.</p>
<p class="p">Includes cannot be made conditional, since conditions are parsed by the application layer. If you want a conditional include in your tagging language, add a field for this purpose to your tagging language.</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">my-include:(?bar) foo.sam
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Naturally, this include must be processed by the application layer.</p>
<p class="p">For similar reasons, an include cannot have a <span class="phrase">name</span>, <span class="phrase">id</span>, or <span class="phrase"><a href=language.html class="link">language</a></span> attribute, since it does not produce a artifact in the output. If you need to apply any of these things to the included content, you can wrap the include statement in another structure such as a <span class="phrase">block</span> or a <span class="phrase">fragment</span> and apply the attributes to that. This will result in the included content being wrapped in that block or fragment in the output where the application layer can deal with it appropriately.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2 class="title">String</h2>

<p class="p">You can define a string variable using the form:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">$foo=bar
</code></pre>
<p class="p">To insert the value of a string, use an insert (block level or inline) with the variable name:</p>
<pre class="codeblock" data-language="sam"><code class="codeblock" data-language="sam">&gt;($title)
</code></pre>
<p class="p">Note that the SAM parser does not resolve strings. The string definitions and string insert instructions are passed through to the application layer and must be resolved by the processing application. This allows the processing application to determine the scope within which string names will be resolved.</p>
