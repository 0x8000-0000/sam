    body: How Fragments Work

        [Fragments](feature) are a [content reuse](task "reusing content" (foo)) feature of the [EPPO-simple](feature)
        [plugin]( feature).

        >>(image foo.gif #foo #bar ?baz ?bat)

        This sentence contains a unmatched [ followed by an [annotated](word).

        This [sentence](grammatical-construct) contains a repeated annotation: the word
        [sentence] without any annotation metadata. It should be annotated the same as
        the previous instance. If you just want square brackets around the word
        \[sentence] you need to preceed it with a backslash.

        This sentence also references the word [sentence] and should be annotated on output.

        A fragment is an \[arbitrary\]\\ sequence of *text structures* (paragraphs, lists,
        etc.) that _has been given_ an id so that it can be [included](bold) by reference at other
        \_points_ in the content.

        ```kkk(xml)
<fragment id="test-fragment">
    <local-strings>
        <string id="test-string-1"><bold>test string one</bold></string>
        <string id="test-string-2"><italic>test string two</italic></string>
    </local-strings>
    <p>This is a piece of text in a fragment. It includes references to local
    strings <string-ref id-ref="test-string-1"/> and <string-ref id-ref="test-string-2"/>.
    And to a global string <string-ref id-ref="product"/></p>
</fragment>
<p>The following is a reference to the fragment defined above:</p>
<fragment-ref id-ref="test-fragment">
    <local-strings>
        <string id="test-string-1"><code>this is test string number one</code></string>
    </local-strings>
</fragment-ref>
        ```kkk

        table:(#my-table ?foobat) An important table
            row:: cell, cell, cell
                foo, bar, baz
                a, b, c
                hi, lo, med

        After this paragraph, there is a blockquote:

        """(book "Mody Dick" (MLA))
            The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

            And the [cow](beast "bovine") jumps over the moon.

        blockquote:(web "http://example.com/page")
            Wafting zyphers quickly vexed jumbo.

            Far and few are the lands where the jumblies live.


        This is another paragraph. Then there is an alternate blockquote:

        '''(this "is the citation" #foo ?bar)
            The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

        '''
            This is a blockquote without a citation.

        Fragments can be defined:

        * inline in a topic file

        * in separate fragment
          collections

          foobar

        * batman


        If a fragment is defined inline, it is included where it occurs. [Fragments](song) in fragment
        files are not included anywhere unless they are pulled in by a fragment reference.

        0. One
           Hundred

           Fifty

        4. Seven

        80976. Two

               Two and a half



        A fragment reference inserts a fragment by ID at the place it occurs in the text.

        Fragments are recursive. That is, [Fragments] can contain other fragments and
        fragment references.

        Because you often want to >>(image foo.gif #foo #bar ?baz ?bat) change some part of a text when it is being
        reused, <fragments> & fragment references can both define local [strings](feature).
        Any [string references](feature) inside a fragment will be resolved by looking first
        at local-strings defined in the fragment reference, then at local strings defined
        in the fragment definition, and then at global strings. In effect, this means
        that you can define string substitutions whenever you insert a fragment into your content.

        This is an incorrectly indented para.

        |p| The p element represents a paragraph. It is recognized as a block of
        lines with no leading tag. It ends with a blank line. p elements are the
        only elements that can contain decorations and annotations.

        |bold| The bold element is a decoration occurring within text and is
        indicated by surrounding the text with asterisks.

        |italic| The italic decoration is indicated by surrounding the text
        with underscores.

        |quotes| The quotes decoration is indicated by surrounding the text
        in straight quotes.

        |mono| The mono decoration is indicated by backticks
