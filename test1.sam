        [Fragments](feature) are a [content reuse](task) feature of the [EPPO-simple](feature)
        [plugin]( feature).

        A fragment is an \[arbitrary\]\\ sequence of *text structures* (paragraphs, lists,
        etc.) that _has been given_ an id so that it can be included by reference at other
        \_points_ in the content.

        ```xml
<fragment id="test-fragment">
    <local-strings>
        <string id="test-string-1"><bold>test string one</bold></string>
        <string id="test-string-2"><italic>test string two</italic></string>
    </local-strings>
    <p>This is a piece of text in a fragment. It includes references to local
    strings <string-ref id-ref="test-string-1"/> and <string-ref id-ref="test-string-2"/>.
    And to a global string <string-ref id-ref="product"/></p>
</fragment>
<p>The following is a reference to the fragment defined above:</p>
<fragment-ref id-ref="test-fragment">
    <local-strings>
        <string id="test-string-1"><code>this is test string number one</code></string>
    </local-strings>
</fragment-ref>
        ```

        table:
            row:: cell, cell, cell
                foo, bar, baz
                a, b, c
                hi, lo, med


        Fragments can be defined:

        * inline in a topic file
        * in separate fragment collections

        If a fragment is defined inline, it is included where it occurs. Fragments in fragment
        files are not included anywhere unless they are pulled in by a fragment reference.

        A fragment reference inserts a fragment by ID at the place it occurs in the text.

        Fragments are recursive. That is, fragments can contain other fragments and
        fragment references.

        Because you often want to change some part of a text when it is being
        reused, fragments and fragment references can both define local [strings](feature).
        Any [string references](feature) inside a fragment will be resolved by looking first
        at local-strings defined in the fragment reference, then at local strings defined
        in the fragment definition, and then at global strings. In effect, this means
        that you can define string substitutions whenever you insert a fragment into your content.
